"""Package: pyerector
A framework to build products based on tasks and targets.  The thought
is, distutils/setuptools is to Maven as PyErector is to Ant.  The former
requires that you shoehorn project to fit into their model.  PyErector is
a toolkit/framework, like Make and Ant, giving you routines to set up
what you want/need to do.  It is geared more toward Python usage, but
most tasks are generic enough for any system.

The developer would create a driver file, commonly named 'pyerect',
that would import the 'pyerector' module and call the PyErector routine.
The smallest driver file would be:
    from pyerector import *
    PyErector()

The PyErector main routine will scan the command-line arguments for
target names, if none are found, then it will call the default target.
Target references on the command-line are the same as the class, but
with the first character lowercase.  The command-line argument 'default'
would refer to the 'Default' Target class.

Command-line arguments must reference targets, not other objects, or
variable assignments.  Instead of referencing a Target, a command-line
argument may also assign a string value to a variable, for example:
"developer.name=Michael".

After command-line arguments are processed, PyErector() will verify the
classes are properly constructed and then call the target references in
turn.

The package is broken into three primary types of objects: standard
targets, standard tasks and the API.  All standard targets could be
subclassed, but would not be, in general.  Instead the class members
would be modified in the driver file:
    InitDirs.files = ('build',)
    Compile.tasks = (Copy('foobar.txt', dest='build'),)

As can be seen with the standard Copy task above, the most common usage
is to create instances within a target's class members, like 'tasks'.

The API allows the developer to extend or change what is being performed
during the build.  For example, in the product's "pyerect" program,
there is a Registration task, which changes the SubPyErector task:
    class Regression(SubPyErector):
        wdir = 'regression'
        proddir = os.path.realpath(os.path.join('build', distfile))
        if 'PYTHONPATH' in os.environ:
            paths = os.environ['PYTHONPATH'].split(os.pathsep)
            paths.append(proddir)
            env = {'PYTHONPATH': os.pathsep.join(paths)}
            del paths
        else:
            env = {'PYTHONPATH': proddir }

This does not change the task's flow, but it does set up certain defaults
which does change the behavior.

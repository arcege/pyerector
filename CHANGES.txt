v1.1.1, 2013-03-31 -- Create proper Iterator classes.

v1.1.2  2013-04-04 -- Add version control modules as 'VCS'.

v1.1.3  2013-05-06
  -- Issue 4 - Uptodate unit tests are skipped
  -- Issue 6 - Build property stack of Target/Task calls...
  -- Issue 7 - Unittests fail on Python 2.6
  -- Issue 8 - Spawn keyword argument processor error and...
  -- Issue 10 - Shebang task does not follow docs
  -- Issue 14 - Basedir is set for current directory, not...
  New tasks
  -- HashGen to create md5/sha1 hash files
  -- Egg to create python archive files
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Add --quiet and --DEBUG options and handling output processing better;
  -- Add timing information after targets and the program finish.
  -- Add new display object, a Verbose object that should (almost) always be on.
  -- Replaced multiple exclusion predicates with a class to handle it.
  -- Use mappers instead of Uptodate instances.
  -- Remove 'noglob' keyword from Initer.get_files() method.
  -- Ignore cases where python3 is not installed.
  -- Add a LOT more unit tests (from 15 tests to 91).
  -- Prevent setup.py running if pyerect is present.
  -- Use setuptools instead of distutils.

v1.2.0  2013-10-13
  -- Issue 11 - Better use of variables; including showing variables on
     verbose output of "help" target.
  -- Issue 12 - Add ability to specify variables on the command-line:
     If a target has an equal sign ("="), then it is taken as a variable
     assignment.
  -- Issue 13 - Update Version model.
  -- Issue 16 - Convert from Config to Variable; Initer.config is kept for
     backward compatibility, but just references Variable
  -- Issue 18 - Replace Verbose instances with Python's logging module.
     -- Add a "DISPLAY" log level above ERROR; keep the display() routine
     -- Use new State class instead for noop and noTimer.
  -- Issue 20 - Make the product thread-safe
  New targets
  -- InitVCS, initializes the version control support
  New tasks
  -- SubPyErector, call other PyErector projects
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Two new constructs: Sequential and Parallel; Parallel is a subclass of
     Sequential; "uptodates", "dependencies" and "tasks" members of implicitly
     instances of Sequential; "uptodates" cannot be Parallel, but the other
     two can be.  Parallel targets/tasks are executed in separate threads but
     may access Variables without concern (see Issue 20).
  -- Add execution stacks for Target and Task instances; this stack is
     displayed instead of Python's on errors.
  -- Add default variables on startup:
     -- basedir (set by PyErector and Initer instantiation)
     -- pyerector.vcs.version
     -- pyerector.vcs.branch
     -- pyerector.vcs.tags
     -- pyerector.release.product
     -- pyerector.release.number
  -- Handle PYERECTOR_PREFIX envvar better.
  -- Remove extraneous "hasformat" functionality.
  -- Fixes to unit tests.
  -- Better help strings.

v1.2.1  2013-10-11
  -- Issue 12 - Add ability to specify variables on the command-line (update)
  -- Issue 15 - Redesign iterators/mappers
  -- Issue 19 - Dirlist does not work as might be expected
  -- Issue 20 - Thread-safe operations (update)
  -- Issue 21 - Backward compatibility for Verbose
  New tasks
  -- Echo, displays message
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Add pyerector.pool.size variable, default to 10, to limit how many
     PyThread instances can be created (not including the PyErector instance).
  -- Update pyerect to better use iterators.
  -- Handle that PyErector always returns an exception, mainly SystemExit
  -- Mark as "Failed." instead of "Done." if an error occurs; have
     PyErector handle a proper exit status on failure.
  -- Update inheritance for LogFormatter - on py2.6, super() throws a TypeError
  -- Use of Verbose and Config classes now raise DeprecationWarnings
  -- Move noop and noTimer to config module.

v1.2.2  2013-10-17
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Add (initial) regression tests.
  -- Fix BaseIterators to properly handle empty directories with
     noglob=True; have Clean Target use DirList.
  -- Fix bug when iterator has an empty sequence.
  -- Have the Help target depend on InitVCS.
  -- Unittest fix for Python3.
  -- Fixes found during analysis from PyCharm and pylint.
  -- Use short-cut class instead of function-with-mutables for initialization.
  -- Some SCM cleanup.

v1.2.3  2013-10-25
  -- Issue 9 - Propagate iterator parameters in Initer.get_files.
  -- Issue 23 - Add an 'api' module to aid programming
  New tasks
  -- Scp, perform remote copies (via scp)
  -- Ssh, perform a remote command (via ssh)
  New iterator/mapper
  -- IdentityMapper, destination file is always the destdir value.
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Allow a Variable instance in a dependencies or tasks sequence.
  -- Code cleanup using PyCharm and pylint.
  -- Collapse FileSet into BaseIterator, make FileSet same as FileIterator.
  -- Greatly simplified the calling system, now allows for nested calls of
     Sequential/Parallel.
  -- Refactor the "allow" condition in BaseIterator.next to be more
     straightforward.
  -- Fix the RealClean target, including a fix to Exclusions.
  -- Fix to Help target for Targets with no docstring.
  -- Fix how the regression module sets the proper sys.path value.
  -- Fix condition where exception was shown on Abort.
  -- Fixes to Subcommand calls.
  -- Change Regression to a Target from a SubPyErector subclass so it can be
     called by itself.
  -- Create symlinks under regression/ to the proper (local) distribution,
     thus overriding sys.path.
  -- Move unittest driver script, named "unit-test.py" (to prevent imports)
     outside of tasks.py; pass the parameters as a string instead of a
     filename.

v1.2.4  2014-04-08
  -- Issue 25 - Move BaseIterator and FileMapper logic to Iterator and
     Mapper respectively; remove BaseIterator.
  -- Issue 26 - Add directory attribute to pyerector.vcs.base.Base
     subclasses; move vcs_check under Base as a classmethod.
  -- Issue 27 - lazy-evaluating Path works, but not properly integrated
     with the rest of the modules.
  -- Issue 28 - Allow a cons as a valid return type of Iterator.next;
     handle that specially in Mapper.next.
  -- Issue 29 - Works as expected.
  New task
  -- Touch which is similar to the touch(1) command, creating files if
     they do not exist.
  New type
  -- FileVariable allows some deferred resolution; file is loaded when
     accessed, not when created.
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- The InitVCS target has been deprecated.  The VCS() function is
     called just before the package finishes being imported.
  -- The Exclusions object now accepts three values: True, False and None;
     False will still include VCS().directory, and None will not include
     any extra values.
  -- Change vcs modules to a plugin type setup, using same registration
     as being used by Initer; plugins loaded automatically when
     pyerector.vcs.VCS is called.
  -- Get the proper information back from Mercurial; previously only the
     tip was retrieve.
  -- Allow for mappers in Tokenize.
  -- Typo in Symlinki task.
  -- Add *.user and *.date variables from VCS.current_info.
  -- Fix the template string for git-log; add an assertion.
  -- Tokenize now allows for multiple Iterators/Mappers to be passed.
  -- Various fixes to Iterators and Mappers; add uptodates entries in
     pyerect.
  -- Do not use assertions for type checking.
  -- Initer.asserttype returns TypeError now.
  -- Blank values for version strings.
  -- Get a closer timestamp for svn.date comparison in unittests.
  -- Allow an Iterator to be passed to Iterator.adjust.
  -- Use th proper version variables.
  -- Remove unused u() function.
  -- Fix unit tests after making Base.args into a tuple.

v1.1.1, 2013-03-31 -- Create proper Iterator classes.

v1.1.2  2013-04-04 -- Add version control modules as 'VCS'.

v1.1.3  2013-05-06
  -- Issue 4 - Uptodate unit tests are skipped
  -- Issue 6 - Build propert stack of Target/Task calls...
  -- Issue 7 - Unittests fail on Python 2.6
  -- Issue 8 - Spawn keyword argument processor error and...
  -- Issue 10 - Shebang task does not follow docs
  -- Issue 14 - Basedir is set for current directory, not...
  New tasks
  -- HashGen to create md5/sha1 hash files
  -- Egg to create python archive files
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Add --quiet and --DEBUG options and handling output processing better;
  -- Add timing information after targets and the program finish.
  -- Add new display object, a Verbose object that should (almost) always be on.
  -- Replaced multiple exclusion predicates with a class to handle it.
  -- Use mappers instead of Uptodate instances.
  -- Remove 'noglob' keyword from Initer.get_files() method.
  -- Ignore cases where python3 is not installed.
  -- Add a LOT more unit tests (from 15 tests to 91).
  -- Prevent setup.py running if pyerect is present.
  -- Use setuptools instead of distutils.

v1.2.0  2013-10-02
  -- Issue 11 - Better use of variables; including showing variables on
     verbose output of "help" target.
  -- Issue 12 - Add ability to specify variables on the command-line:
     If a target has an equal sign ("="), then it is taken as a variable
     assignment.
  -- Issue 13 - Update Version model.
  -- Issue 16 - Convert from Config to Variable; Initer.config is kept for
     backward compatibility, but just references Variable
  -- Issue 18 - Replace Verbose instances with Python's logging module.
     -- Add a "DISPLAY" log level above ERROR; keep the display() routine
     -- Use new State class instead for noop and noTimer.
  -- Issue 20 - Make the product thread-safe
  New targets
  -- InitVCS, initializes the version control support
  New tasks
  -- SubPyErector, call other PyErector projects
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Two new constructs: Sequential and Parallel; Parallel is a subclass of
     Sequential; "uptodates", "dependencies" and "tasks" members of implicitly
     instances of Sequential; "uptodates" cannot be Parallel, but the other
     two can be.  Parallel targets/tasks are executed in separate threads but
     may access Variables without concern (see Issue 20).
  -- Add execution stacks for Target and Task instances; this stack is
     displayed instead of Python's on errors.
  -- Add default variables on startup:
     -- basedir (set by PyErector and Initer instantiation)
     -- pyerector.vcs.version
     -- pyerector.vcs.branch
     -- pyerector.vcs.tags
     -- pyerector.release.product
     -- pyerector.release.number
  -- Handle PYERECTOR_PREFIX envvar better.
  -- Remove extraneous "hasformat" functionality.
  -- Fixes to unit tests.
  -- Better help strings.

v1.2.1  2013-10-11
  -- Issue 12 - Add ability to specify variables on the command-line (update)
  -- Issue 15 - Redesign iterators/mappers
  -- Issue 19 - Dirlist does not work as might be expected
  -- Issue 20 - Thread-safe operations (update)
  -- Issue 21 - Backward compatibility for Verbose
  New tasks
  -- Echo, displays message
  Other fixes/enhancements:
  -- Add pyerector.pool.size variable, default to 10, to limit how many
     PyThread instances can be created (not including the PyErector instance).
  -- Update pyerect to better use iterators.
  -- Handle that PyErector always returns an exception, mainly SystemExit
  -- Mark as "Failed." instead of "Done." if an error occurs; have
     PyErector handle a proper exit status on failure.
  -- Update inheritance for LogFormatter - on py2.6, super() throws a TypeError
  -- Use of Verbose and Config classes now raise DeprecationWarnings
